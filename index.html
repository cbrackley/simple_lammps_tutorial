<b><h1><u>A very basic LAMMPS tutorial</u></h1></b>

<br><br>

This is a very simple and quick tutorial on how to use LAMMPS to simulate a polymer using Langevin dynamics. I've tried to add links to the LAMMPS <a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Manual.html">manual</a> and other sources where appropriate. The input scripts include further comments detailing what each command does.
